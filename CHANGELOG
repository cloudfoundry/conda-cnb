v0.0.1 May 08, 2019
====================

* Conda-cnb runs when it detects an environment.yml in the app root dir

* The buildpack requests conda in the buildplan and supplies a conda environment
  with the python version in package-list.txt or environment.yml.

* Conda should not run with Python-cnb; it runs in its own group.
